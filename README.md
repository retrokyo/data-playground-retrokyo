# Data Playground
## My personal repo for playing around with different technologies

### data-gen
Is a simple create-react-app bootstrapped React App
The goal of this was to create something where I could generate a mass amount of data points
Currently it is a simple click the box game that when running records the users mouse movements, and score

### data-gen-backend
Is a simple Flask project
It is intended as an API for passing the data generated in data-gen
